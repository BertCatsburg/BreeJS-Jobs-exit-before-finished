# BreeJS Github Issue

## First try with Console.log
This one belongs to [https://github.com/breejs/bree/issues/121](https://github.com/breejs/bree/issues/121)

Conclusion is not to use console.log in a Worker. 
You have to send them back to the Parent. 

## Other solution: Logging to a File
This one belongs to https://github.com/breejs/bree/issues/123

Here I try logging to a file. 

But also this one does not work. 

There's something strange with BreeJS (or the NodeJS-Workers in the background)
